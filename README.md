# Data Project Template

<h1 align="center">
A Template project for Data Science & AI Projects
</h1>

## Cookiecutter Data Science
This project template is a simplified version of the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org) template, created to suit the needs of Datalumina and made available as a GitHub template.

## Project Setup

### 1. UV Installation
This project uses uv for dependency management. If you haven't installed uv yet, you can do so by following the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### 2. Setting up the Project
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

> Make sure the host machine has `python = ">=3.10,<3.13"`

```bash
uv venv my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Lab server🚀

After Environment is activated, run below command for Jupyter lab Server

```bash

Jupyter lab

```

## Adjusting .gitignore

Ensure you adjust the `.gitignore` file according to your project needs. For example, since this is a template, the `/data/` folder is commented out and data will not be exlucded from source control:

```plaintext
# exclude data from source control by default
# /data/
```

Typically, you want to exclude this folder if it contains either sensitive data that you do not want to add to version control or large files.

## Duplicating the .env File
To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # Linux, macOS, Git Bash, WSL
copy .env.example .env # Windows Command Prompt
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.
